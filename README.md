This is a node.js program that simulates an imaginary hoover moving through a room to clean up dirt patches. This exercise assumes you are running node.js on a Mac.

If you don't have node or npm installed, you can follow the directions here: https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac

Instructions to run program:

All you need is to navigate to the main project directory (e.g. first level inside tray/ directory) and run 'node main.js'. It will read in from input.txt and you can try different inputs.

Way to run unit tests:

You will need to run 'npm install mocha -g' to install Mocha, a popular Node.js framework for unit testing. Once it succeeds, you can stay on the main project directory (e.g. first level inside tray/ directory) and run 'mocha'.
